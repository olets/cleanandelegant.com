[![ci](https://github.com/olets/resume-nuxt/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/olets/resume-nuxt/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

My resume site, in Nuxt.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

When `main` is pushed, a GitHub Action builds and deploys to https://cleanandelegant.com/ via FTP.
